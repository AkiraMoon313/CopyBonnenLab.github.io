# Getting Started on IU's supercomputers

Prerequisites: These instructions will assume that you're familiar with the material covered in [Software Carpentries Unix Shell Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice).  This material will cover how to use the shell to move around and manipulate files on a computer.

### Carbonate and Big Red 3
The lab works primarily on two of the supercomputers, Carbonate (Matlab works more readily on this one) and Big Red 3.

## Create computing accounts.
To use Carbonate, Big Red 3 and/or Slate you will need to ["create additional computing accounts" with IU](https://access.iu.edu/Accounts/Create).  Select the systems you want to create an account on and click create accounts.  Provide any additional information that they request.  Once you've created the accounts it will take a couple of hours for the request to be processed.  Then you will be able to log-in via SSH with your IU username and password.


### Storage
[A current overview of the storage available in conjunction with IU's supercomputers](https://kb.iu.edu/d/avkm).

On each supercomputer you will have a home directory with an allocation of 100GB.  You may also request additional storage (default 800GB and up to 1.6TB) on Slate.  For projects with larger storage needs or a project with data shared across multiple users, we can request space on Slate-Project where we can request up to 15TB for free (with charges for larger storage requests).


## Logging in to the supercomputer for the first time

## An easier way to log-in

## Using Sublime as your text editor

## Using RED desktop (a.k.a. I don't like this command-line stuff)

## Moving / Copying large amounts of data
Use rclone...
