# Getting Started on IU's supercomputers

Prerequisites: These instructions will assume that you're familiar with the material covered in [Software Carpentries Unix Shell Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice).  This material will cover how to use the shell to move around and manipulate files on a computer.

### Carbonate and Big Red 3

The lab works primarily on two of the supercomputers, Carbonate (Matlab works more readily on this one) and Big Red 3.

### Storage

On each supercomputer you will have a home directory with an allocation of XXXGB.  You may also request additional storage (default XXXGB and up to XXXGB) on Slate.  For projects with larger storage needs or project shared across multiple users, we can request space on Slate-Project which can be shared with multiple individuals.

## Create computing accounts.
To use Carbonate, Big Red 3 and/or Slate you will need to ["create additional computing accounts" with IU](https://access.iu.edu/Accounts/Create).  Select the systems you want to create an account on and click create accounts.  Provide any additional information that they request.  Once you've created the accounts it will take a couple of hours for the request to be processed.  Then you will be able to log-in via SSH with your IU username and password.

## Logging in to the supercomputer for the first time

## An easier way to log-in

## Using Sublime as your text editor

## Using RED desktop (a.k.a. I don't like this command-line stuff)

## Moving / Copying large amounts of data
Use rclone...

## Current Slate-Project Accounts
