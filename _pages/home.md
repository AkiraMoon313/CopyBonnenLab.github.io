**The Vision in Action Lab**, led by [Dr. Kathryn Bonnen](/people/bonnen), studies visual perception, sensorimotor systems and the neural computations that underlie them. Our research relies on behavioral measurements (psychophysics, eye tracking, body motion capture) and computational modeling (of behavior, neural processing and the world).  We borrow neural data from our friends and collaborators. We strive, even in our laboratory experiments, to understand the visual system and sensorimotor systems in contexts relevant to daily life (e.g., walking, balance, object tracking). In the lab we use both typical visual displays and virtual reality. Sometimes we go hiking for science... 

**Ultimately we are scientists, engineers, tinkerers, and dreamers who want to understand how the brain solves the immensely difficult problems involved in gathering information in the world and acting on it.**

We are located in the [School of Optometry](https://optometry.iu.edu/) at [Indiana University](https://www.indiana.edu/) and are affiliated with a number of departments and cross-disciplinary programs, including the Graduate programs in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science. 

**We are currently looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Masters students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/positions) **!**
