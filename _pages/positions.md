<h1 align="center"> Come join us in the Vision in Action Lab! </h1>

We are always looking for new lab members with enthusiasm for science and scientific research.  Members of the Vision in Action Lab come from a variety of backgrounds (vision science, neuroscience, computer science, optometry, biomechanics, biology, public health, etc.).  Our work is inherently interdisciplinary and we learn from each other's varying backgrounds.
