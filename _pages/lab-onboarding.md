# Welcome to the Vision in Action Lab!

There are few things we need you to do in order to get started.

## A. Join the Discord!  
This is where we troubleshoot problems, discuss science, and manage logistics when we cannot be together in-person.  If you haven't received a link, then you should ask one of your labmates (or Kate) to invite you.

## B. Join the Lab Github 
We share and actively review each other's code.  Don't worry if you've never used Github or git (version control) before, you will learn in lab.
1. Make a Github account (if you don't have one).
2. Share your github username with Kate so she can add you to the BonnenLab organization.

3. If you're new to version control / git / github, you'll want to check out the Software Carpentries Introduction to git, which might require you to first learn about the Unix Shell.

## C. IRB training
In the lab we work with human participants and their data.  To do either of these things, you will need to be approved to do so by the IU Institutional Review Board.

1. Complete the IRB training: 
2. Notify Kate that you have completed the training so she can file an ammendment to have you added to her IRB.
3. Then you're official!  You can be trained to collect data or be allowed to have access to data.

## D. Add yourself to the lab website!  (aka make your first Bonnen Lab pull request).
I want everyone who works in lab to show up on our [Team page](https://bonnenlab.github.io/people/) on the website.  In order to show up you will want to:
1. Fork the repository. 
2. Add an image of yourself to the images/teampic/ folder following the first-last.jpg naming convention
3. Add your information to the data/team_members.yml file, following the structure that you see.  For example, if my name is Joanne Smith and I'm a Masters Student participating in the FADS summer program. I might put:

An example:

    - name: Joanne Smith
      photo: joanne-smith.png
      info: Masters Student -- FADS program
      department: Data Science, Luddy School
      link: [personal website](https://joanne-smith.com)
  
 You are welcome to create a person page hosted here as well or you can put it in your separate/external page. Place it in the folder pages/individuals/ and then simply put the name of the .md file next to link (see Kate's, bonnen.md, for an example).  You can also leave the link line off if you'd prefer not to have a personal page or you want to add it later.
 
Example without link:

    - name: Joanne Smith
      photo: joanne-smith.png
      info: Undergraduate Research Assistant
      department: Neuroscience
  
Example with personal page hosted on Bonnen Lab:

    - name: Joanne Smith
      photo: joanne-smith.png
      info: OD/MS student
      department: Optometry
      link: joanne-smith
      
4. Now make a pull request and assign it to Kate for review!


## E. Read the lab manual -- COMING SOON (so you don't have to do this yet.)
